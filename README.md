# NameMC Scrapper
> A basic Chrome Extension that i made to get skins from NameMC.
I made this because NameMC protects their site using Cloudflare and i didn't abled to bypass Cloudflare via NodeJS

# How to use
- Change amout as whatever you want (if you set to 10, 300 skins 
will be scrapped)

- Open chrome://extensions in Google Chrome

- Press the "Load unpacked" button located in top left

- Select extension folder

- Start extension from card list

- Press service worker to see logs
